                You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

                Like you, I used to think the world was this      great place where everybody lived by the same     standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is   not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to play by his rules, then you're     gonna have to pay the price.</p>
